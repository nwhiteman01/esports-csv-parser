Esports CSV Parser is a program that will take in the mega data from Oracleâ€™s Elixir CSV League of Legends file and parse that data for LCK players. 
It will specifically look for the games of the previous week and calculate the total amount of points for that week. It will then store that
into a .txt file that will keep that information for the next week. Scoring system was designed my me and will be posted once it is fully
fleshed out.
